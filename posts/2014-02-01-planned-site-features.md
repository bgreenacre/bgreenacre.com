So this site is just a blog for me but it's clearly missing some features right now that you'd see in a typical blog site. This is because I'm building this site from scratch. I'd like to go through those features now and let you know if and when I plan on implementing any of them.

###Comments

Being able to comment on an article is a major feature that is currently missing from my blog. This is due in part to the fact that commenting systems on any site are difficult to write _well_. It's easy to write a comment system if you don't care about things like spam, authors that are actually subscribers vs anonymous users or a boatload of security concerns I'd rather not get into details about. Since I want to write a _good_ comment system it's going to take time and effort on my part so everyone will just have to bare with me.

Some of you web-savy folk are probably screaming at me to just use a third party service like disquis or twitter or facebook and that's something I'm not going to do. Mostly because I don't _need_ to and also because I'm **sick** of seeing web sites with tons of embedded third party services that make the site run slow even on my beast laptop. So it's worth the time and effort to just put in the time and effort into developing a good comment system for my blog.

###Users

Yup I have no signin/signup ability right now and that's really just because I haven't done it yet. It's not that difficult to do really since there's so many toolsets available to help but it's kind of one of those boring pieces of any website that it's now a chore to get done rather than something fun and interesting to do. This feature will likely be added soon so quit complaining.

I _might_ integrate third party login abilities. You'll be able to login with google+, facebook or twitter. I don't see myself trying to integrate more than that though.

###Archive

Yeah I know, that's a pretty obvious thing I'm missing right now. Although it's important to have I clearly don't need it now since I have no content on here.

###Categories/Tags

I actually do have that implemented but my meager 2 posts aren't under a category or tagged now.

###Search

Not really imporant right now but this will be implemented in the future.

###Mailing List/Notifications

Mailing lists are so pre-2000 but whatever. I get it. People like email and I bet most reading this wouldn't mind signing up for a mailing list. This is a low priority for me and you're going to see users and comments implemented before I do a mailing list. Also, I'm not writing a newsletter. That's just stupid. I will, however, send out simple notifications to any subscriber on new posts added to the site.

###What? No google+, facebook share, pin it, linkedin or twitter share?

First, NO! Second, you guys know that for most of those sites you _could_ just copy and paste the url into a post on your account right?

###Ratings

I don't see the point of doing that. If you like or hate an article you'll likely say it in the comments (that don't exist now).

These are the features I wanted to talk about here. Some will make it and some won't.
